The CPU drivers are based on StarterWare by Texas Instruments. The hardware abstraction, build environment and code examples provided the stepping-stone needed to get started.</p> <p>In much the same way, the DSP drivers are based on [monome/aleph](https://github.com/monome/aleph. This showed how to initialise the Blackfin processor and configure peripherals. They also provide a public domain DSP library, with many of the difficult maths problems packaged into convenient unit generators.</p> <p>MIDI input parsing is based on mikromodular/libmidi, with sysex/binary conversion borrowed from the Arduino MIDI library by Francois Best.</p> <p>UGUI and micromenu provide a graphical interface for user applications.</p> <p>Special thanks to countless stackoverflow users.</p>"},{"location":"features/","title":"Features","text":"<p>From a user application perspective, Freetribe is currently light on features.
