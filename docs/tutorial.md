# Freetribe Tutorial

Visit the [Freetribe Tutorial](https://bangcorrupt.github.io/freetribe-tutorial) 
for a series of  tutorials demonstrating features of the Freetribe API.
Each tutorial builds on the last, moving from a simple blinking LED, 
to a more complex application with user input, audio processing,
MIDI handling and feedback to the display.
