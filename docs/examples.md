# Examples

The main demo uses the volume knob to control attenuation of audio pass-through,
while sending MIDI CC and printing to the display. Recevied MIDI note messages are
echoed to the output and an LED blinks at regular intervals.
An external library is integrated for GUI management.

Future examples will deal separately with individual features,
building up to a more complex application.
